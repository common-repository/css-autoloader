Load CSS files without coding

== Description ==

The Smart CSS Auto Loader Plugin allows you to load additional CSS files without the need to change the theme

== Retired Plugin ==

Development, maintenance and support of this plugin has been retired in october 2023. You can use this plugin as long as is works for you. 

There will be no more updates and I won't answer any support questions. Thanks for your understanding.

Feel free to fork this plugin.

== Usage ==

To load additional stylesheets just put them into a directory named **cssautoload** (case-sensitive!). This directory can be placed in three different locations that are loaded in the following order:

* Theme independent : in the `wp-content` directory
* Theme dependent : in the Theme's directory
* Child Theme dependent (if using a Child Theme) : in the Child Theme's directory

Only files with extension .css are added, all other files are ignored. Also files beginning with an underscore (_) are ignored.

== CSS for different media ==

CSS allows to have different styles for different target devices. Files placed directly in the `cssautoload` directory are added with the media type 'all', suitable for all devices. To use a different media type just create a subdirectory with the name of the target media type (case-sensitive!). Te following CSS media types are supported according to the official CSS standard:

* `all` for all devices - you don't need to create the `all` directory, you also can put the files directly into the cssautoload root directory
* `braille` for braille tactile feedback devices
* `embossed` for paged braille printers
* `handheld` for handheld devices
* `print` for printouts or print preview on screen
* `projection` for projected presentations
* `screen` for screens
* `speech` for speech synthesizers
* `tty` for media using a fixed-pitch character grid
* `tv` for television-type devices

Other subdirectories in `cssautoload` directory are ignored. Also subdirectories in the media subdirectories are not supported.
